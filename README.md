In order to be able to access the [Oracle Maven Repository](https://maven.oracle.com/), the `settings.xml` file must be placed in the `$HOME/.m2 directory`. You must provide the username and password for your [Oracle account](https://login.oracle.com/mysso/signon.jsp?request_id=007) in the `settings.xml` file. For this, you should use [password encryption](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).
